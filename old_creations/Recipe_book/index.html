                <h3>Recipe</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Rinse &frac12; cup raw rice and &frac14; cup moong dal together two times with water.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a pressure cooker or thick-bottomed pot, add 1 teaspoon ghee and roast the moong dal on low flame until aromatic (do not brown).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the washed rice to the dal and roast both for 1 minute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour in 3 and half cups of water and add salt as needed (about half to 1 teaspoon).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add <span>&frac12;</span> teaspoon grated ginger and a pinch of asafoetida (hing) to the pot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        pressure cook for 3 - 4 whistles on medium flame (or simmer covered until both rice and dal are soft and mushy).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a small pan, heat 2 tablespoons ghee, add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 teaspoon black pepper (crushed or whole), and 10 - 12 cashews.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once cashews turn golden, add a sprig of curry leaves and saute for a few seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour this tempering/tadka over the cooked rice-dal mixture and mix well. If it is too thick, you can add a bit of hot boiling water to get the right soft, runny texture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar for a classic Tamil breakfast experience.

                <h3>Recipe</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Wash 1 cup whole wheat (samba wheat) and soak it overnight or for at least 8 hours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drain the water and grind the soaked wheat with some water in a blender to a smooth paste.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Strain this mixture through a fine sieve or cloth to extract the wheat milk. Repeat grinding and extracting to get more milk. Set the milk aside for 3-4 hours to settle, then discard the top clear liquid.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prepare sugar caramel by heating 2.5 cups sugar with ¼ cup water in a pan until it reaches one string consistency (threads form when pulled).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour the wheat milk slowly into the hot sugar syrup on low flame. Stir continuously to mix well and cook.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep stirring until the mixture thickens; start adding ghee tablespoon by tablespoon while stirring.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Continue stirring and adding ghee gradually. Cook until the halwa absorbs all the ghee and starts releasing oil/ghee at the sides—it becomes glossy and soft but holds together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add fried cashew nuts and a pinch of cardamom powder for flavor and mix thoroughly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep stirring on low flame for 15-20 minutes until the halwa changes to a pale color and leaves the sides of the pan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve hot in bowls or spread on a greased plate, let cool, and cut into pieces if desired.
                    </li>

                <h3>Recipe</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Soak 1 cup urad dal in water for 4-5 hours or overnight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drain the water and grind the urad dal with very little water to a smooth, fluffy batter. Do not add too much water, batter should be thick and airy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Chop 1 finely chopped onion, 2 green chilies, a small piece of ginger, coriander leaves, and curry leaves. Add these to the batter along with <span>&frac12;</span> teaspoon salt and mix well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds and a pinch of asafoetida (hing) to the batter for flavor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium heat for deep frying.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wet your hands, take a small portion of batter, and flatten it slightly into a donut shape with a hole in the center.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Carefully slip the prepared vada into hot oil. Fry a few at a time without overcrowding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fry on medium heat until the vada turns golden brown and crisp on both sides. Flip occasionally for even cooking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove the vadas with a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on kitchen paper towels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar for a classic Tamil breakfast or snack.

                <h3>Recipe</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Separate the leaves from the stems of 2 cups black nightshade greens (Manithakkali Keerai) and wash thoroughly to remove all dirt.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Slice 5 small shallots (small onions) and slightly crush 1 teaspoon cumin seeds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 2 cups water (or water from rice washing called kazhani thanneer), bring to boil and add the sliced shallots, crushed cumin seeds, a pinch of sugar, and the cleaned greens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cook the mixture on medium flame until the greens are soft (around 20-30 minutes) adding salt halfway through cooking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Meanwhile, grind &frac12; cup grated fresh coconut with about &frac14; cup lukewarm water to extract coconut milk; squeeze well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the greens are cooked, switch off the stove and add the extracted coconut milk.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stir well, and do not boil the mixture after adding coconut milk; just warm it up gently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Temper cumin seeds in a teaspoon of hot oil, then add dry red chilies and curry leaves.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour this tempering over the cooked keerai thanni and mix well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve hot as a healthy soup or with rice mixed with ghee, perfect for soothing mouth ulcers or digestion.

                    <li>
                        Once cooked, mash the rice gently with a spoon or whisk to remove lumps. Let it cool to room temperature.
